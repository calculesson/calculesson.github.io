	<h2>3rd grade</h2>
	Several units lead to high school math.<br>
	It is important to review all the units you learned in junior high school.

	<h3>What You Can Learn Here</h3>
	<ul class="contents">
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Factorization</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					Put simply, factorization is the process of taking an addition or subtraction expression and turning it into a multiplication expression.<br>
					You can say it is the opposite of formula expansion.<br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					It is one way to solve the quadratic equation, which you will learn in a later unit.<br>
					Also, you can use factorization to devise a calculation.<br>
					ex) 101&times;101-99&times;99.
				</div>
			</section>
		</li>
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Square Root</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					The square root of <span class="literal">a</span> is a number that becomes <span class="literal">a</span> when you square it.<br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					Maybe you imagine a square root as the length of one side of a square.<br>
					Also, A4 and B5 paper is made so that the aspect ratio is 1:&radic;2.
				</div>
			</section>
		</li>
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Quadratic Equations</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					An equation whose highest degree is 2.<br>
					It is expressed in the form <span class="literal">ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0</span><br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					There are many numbers that you can't find only with the linear equations learned in the 1st grade of junior high school.<br>
					If you combine them with the "function <span class="literal">y=ax<sup>2</sup></span>" learned in a later unit and the quadratic function learned in high school math I, you can find more numbers.
				</div>
			</section>
		</li>
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Function<span class="literal"> y=ax<sup>2</sup></span></h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					It is a function where <span class="literal">y</span> is proportional to  <span class="literal">x</span>squared.<br>
					The graph of this function is a curve called a parabola.<br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					A parabola represents the motion of a thrown object.<br>
					They are also used in parabolic antennas that receive radio waves.<br>
					By studying this unit, you can understand the basics of quadratic functions that you will learn in high school.
