	The name changes from arithmetic to math, and you probably make the mistake of saying "arithmetic is..." many times.

	<h3>What You Can Learn Here</h3>
	<ul class="contents">
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Positive/Negative Numbers</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					<strong>Positive Numbers</strong>: greater than 0. <strong>Negative Numbers</strong>: less than 0.<br>
					This is the first unit that students learn about numbers less than 0.<br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					ex) when you say a low temperature like "-5 &deg;C"<br>
					In addition, "-50% discount" means that it is more expensive than the original price.
				</div>
			</section>
		</li>
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Four Operations with Positive & Negative Numbers</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					You will do the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) by using positive and negative numbers.
				</div>
			</section>
		</li>
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Literal Equation</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					You represent numbers by replacing them with letters such as<span class="literal"> a </span>or<span class="literal"> x</span>.<br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					You can make an equation even if you don't know what number will go into it.<br>
					ex) when you want to know how much money you need. You let the price for one pencil be<span class="literal"> x </span>and express the price for four pencils as 4<span class="literal"> x </span>(yen).<br>
					An advantage of using letters is that it takes less time to write explanations and equations.
				</div>
			</section>
		</li>
		<li>
			<section>
				<h4 class="unit">Linear Equations in One Variable</h4>
				<div class="explanation">
					It is the equation that the degree of a polynomial is 1. The degree of a polinomial is the largest sum of the exponents of all variables in a term, so you don't use<span class="literal"> xy </span>or<span class="literal"> x</span><sup class="num">2 </sup>in this unit.<br>
					<span class="head">When Do You Use It?</span><br>
					You can find the numbers you want to know about your daily life by making and solving an equation.<br>
					ex) when you want to know when to leave your home. You can find the best answer while considering the walking speed or the time you want to arrive.
